# Getting started

In a terminal, move to this directory `cd source/nodejs/tests/ui-tests`

## Building

1. Execute the `build` task `npm run build`

## Executing the tests

1. Execute the `test` task `npm run test`. This step rebuilds the test so you should not have to rebuild manually everytime you make a test change.
